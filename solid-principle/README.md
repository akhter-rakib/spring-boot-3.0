Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):

The **AccountService** interface and **AccountServiceImpl** class demonstrate **SRP** by handling only the responsibility related to account operations, such as registration.
CalculatorFactory focuses on the responsibility of creating and dispatching InterestCalculator instances based on the account type.
LoanAccountInterestCalculator focuses solely on calculating interest for loan accounts.

Open/Closed Principle (OCP):

The **CalculatorFactory** and **InterestCalculator** interface adhere to the OCP by allowing the **system to be easily extended** with new types of InterestCalculator implementations without modifying existing code.
Adding a new type of account or interest calculator wouldn't require changes to the existing code but rather implementing new classes that adhere to the existing interfaces.

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):

In the provided code, LoanAccountInterestCalculator can be substituted for InterestCalculator, ensuring that any code using InterestCalculator can also use LoanAccountInterestCalculator without issues.

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):

The **InterestCalculator** interface is focused and **doesn't include unnecessary methods**. It only declares methods related to interest calculation and getting the account type, adhering to ISP.

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):

DIP is **exhibited through the constructor injection** used in AccountServiceImpl to receive dependencies (AccountRepository and CalculatorFactory). This allows AccountServiceImpl to depend on abstractions (AccountRepository interface and CalculatorFactory interface) rather than concrete implementations, promoting loose coupling and flexibility.
