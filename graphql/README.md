What is GraphQL?
GraphQL is a modern query language and a runtime for APIs
It is built around the concept of **"get exactly what you asked for".**


GraphQL makes it easier to **aggregate data from multiple sources,** and **uses a type system to describe data rather than multiple endpoints**.

In summation, the 3 key characteristics of what makes GraphQL a dream syntax are:
1. Clients can specify exactly what data they need
2. Aggregating data from multiple sources is easy, and
3. GraphQL uses a type system to describe data rather than endpoints.

**_Over the last few years, REST has been used to make new APIs, while the focus of GraphQL has been to optimize for performance and flexibility._**
